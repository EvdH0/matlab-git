I'm still not happy with how the editing of commit messages is working out.

Ideally anytime GIT needs user the matlab editor would display the file to 
be edited or a fake teminal (written in matlab) would open up. Its not clear 
how to do this though without explicitly parsing the commands or the result 

Another option would be to NOT call GIT directly from Matlab but rather to 
execute a simple java program that could then execute commands in Matlab, 
using MatlabControl this might allow the functionality that I'm looking for

 (http://code.google.com/p/matlabcontrol/) into this.
